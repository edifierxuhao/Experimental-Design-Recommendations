    "## Experimental Design\n",
    "Within the experimental design portion of this course, there are three lessons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Concepts of Experiment Design\n",
    "Here you will learn about what it means to run an experiment, and how this differs from observational studies. Topics include not only what to include in an experimental design, but also what to watch out for when designing an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Statistical Considerations in Testing\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about statistical techniques and considerations used when evaluating the data collected during an experiment. It is expected that you come into the course with knowledge about inferential statistics; the content here will see you applying that knowledge in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. A/B Testing Case Study\n",
    "Here, you will put your skills to work to analyze data related to a change on a web page designed to increase purchasers of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of these lessons, you can complete an optional Portfolio Exercise in coordination with our industry partner Starbucks. In the project, you will learn more about how Starbucks conducts experiments. You will also get access to data related to a hiring screen that was once conducted by Starbucks to test ideas related to experimental design and statistical metrics.\n",
    "******\n",
    "## Recommendation Engines\n",
    "The recommendation engines portion of the course has two lessons:\n",

    "## Types of Study\n",
    "There are many ways in which data can be collected in order to test or understand the relationship between two variables of interest. These methods can be put into three main bins, based on the amount of control that you hold over the variables in play:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have a lot of control over features, then you have an **experiment**.\n",
    "- If you have no control over the features, then you have an **observational study**.\n",
    "- If you have some control, then you have a **quasi-experiment**.\n",
    "While the experiment is the main focus of this course, it's also useful to know about the other types of study so that you can use them in effective ways, especially if an experiment cannot be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "In the social and medical sciences, an experiment is defined by comparing outcomes between two or more groups, and ensuring equivalence between the compared groups except for the manipulation that we want to test. Our interest in an experiment is to see if a change in one feature has an effect in the value of a second feature, like seeing if changing the layout of a button on a website causes more visitors to click on it. Having multiple groups is necessary in order to compare the outcome for when we apply the manipulation to when we do not (e.g. old vs. new website layout), or to compare different levels of manipulation (e.g. drug dosages). We also need equivalence between groups so that we can be as sure as possible that the differences in the outcomes were only due to the difference in our manipulated feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalence between groups is typically carried out through some kind of randomization procedure. A **unit of analysis** is the entity under study, like a page view or a user in a web experiment. If we randomly assign our units of analysis to each group, then on the whole, we should expect the feature distributions between groups to be about the same. This theoretically isolates the changes in the outcome to the changes in our manipulated feature. Of course, we can always dig deeper afterwards to see if certain other features worked in tandem with, or against, our manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observational Studies\n",
    "In an experiment, we exert a lot of control on a system in order to narrow down the changes in our system from one source to one output. Observational studies, on the other hand, are defined by a lack of control. Observational studies are also known as naturalistic or correlational studies. In an observational study, no control is exerted on the variables of interest, perhaps due to ethical concerns or a lack of power to enact the manipulation. This often comes up in medical studies. For example, if we want to look at the effects of smoking on health, the potential risks make it unethical to force people into smoking behaviors. Instead, we need to rely on existing data or groups to make our determinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically cannot infer causality in an observational study due to our lack of control over the variables. Any relationship observed between variables may be due to unobserved features, or the direction of causality might be uncertain. (We'll discuss this more later in the lesson.) But simply because an observational study does not imply causation does not mean that it is not useful. An interesting relationship might be the spark needed to perform additional studies or to collect more data. These studies can help strengthen the understanding of the relationship we're interested in by ruling out more and more alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quasi-Experiments\n",
    "In between the observational study and the experiment is the quasi-experiment. This is where some, but not all, of the control requirements of a true experiment are met. For example, rolling out a new website interface to all users to see how much time they spend on it might be considered a quasi-experiment. While the manipulation is controlled by the experimenter, there aren't multiple groups to compare. The experimenter can still use the behavior of the population pre-change and compare that to behaviors post-change, to make judgment on the effects of the change. However, there is the possibility that there are other effects outside of the manipulation that caused the observed changes in behavior. For the example earlier in this paragraph, it might be that users would have naturally gravitated to higher usage rates, regardless of the website interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, we might have two different groups upon which to make a comparison of outcomes, but the original groups themselves might not be equivalent. A classic example of this is if a researcher wants to test some new supplemental materials for a high school course. If they select two different schools, one with the new materials and one without, we have a quasi-experiment since the differing qualities of students or teachers at those schools might have an effect on the outcomes. Ideally, we'd like to match the two schools before the test as closely as possible, but we can't call it a true experiment since the assignment of student to school can't be considered random.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a quasi-experiment may not have the same strength of causality inference as a true experiment, the results can still provide a strong amount of evidence for the relationship being investigated. This is especially true if some kind of matching is performed to identify similar units or groups. Another benefit of quasi-experimental designs is that the relaxation of requirements makes the quasi-experiment more flexible and easier to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Reading\n",
    "[This](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/upshot/nike-vaporfly-shoe-strava.html) fascinating New York Times article details different ways of investigating the claim that Nike's Vaporfly running shoes provide a significant advantage in running speed, despite not being able to run a true, randomized experiment."

    "## Types of Experiment\n",
    "Most of the time, when you think of an experiment, you think of a **between-subjects** experiment. In a between-subjects experiment, each unit only participates in, or sees, one of the conditions being used in the experiment. The simplest of these has just two groups or conditions to compare. In one group, we have either no manipulation, or maintenance of the status quo. This is like providing a known drug treatment, or an old version of a website. This is known as the **control group**. The other group includes the manipulation we wish to test, such as a new drug or new website layout. This is known as our **experimental group**. We can compare the outcomes between groups (e.g. recovery time or click-through rate) in order to make a judgement about the effect of our manipulation. (Since we have an experiment, we'll randomly assign each unit to either the control or experimental group.) For web-based experiments, this kind of basic experiment design is called an **A/B test**: the \"A\" group representing the old control, and \"B\" representing the new experimental change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aren't limited to just two groups. We could have multiple experimental groups to compare, rather than just one control group and one experimental group. This could form an A/B/C test for a web-based experiment, with control group \"A\" and experimental groups \"B\" and \"C\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual completes all conditions, rather than just one, this is known as a **within-subjects** design. Within-subjects designs are also known as repeated measures designs. By measuring an individual's output in all conditions, we know that the distribution of features in the groups will be equivalent. We can account for individuals' aptitudes or inclinations in our analysis. For example, if an individual rates three different color palettes for a product, we can know if a high rating for one palette is particularly good compared to the others (e.g. 10 vs. 5, 6) or if it's not a major distinction (e.g. 10 vs. 8, 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomization still has a part in the within-subjects design in the order in which individuals complete conditions. This is important to reduce potential bias effects, as will be discussed later in the lesson. One other downside of the within-subjects design is that it's not always possible to pull off a within-subjects design. For example, when a user visits a website and completes their session, we usually can't guarantee when they'll come back. The purpose of their following visit also might not be comparable to their first. It can take a lot more effort in control in order to set up an effective within-subjects design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side Note: Factorial Designs\n",
    "Factorial designs manipulate the value of multiple features of interest. For example, with two independent manipulations \"X\" and \"Y\", we have four conditions: \"control\", \"X only\", \"Y only\", \"X and Y\". Experimental designs where multiple features are manipulated simultaneously are more frequently seen in engineering and physical sciences domains, where the system units tend to be under stricter control. They're less seen in the social and medical realms, where individual differences can impede experiment creation and analysis."

    "## Types of Sampling\n",
    "While web and other online experiments have an easy time collecting data, collecting data from traditional methods involving real populations is a much more difficult proposition. If you need to perform a survey of a population, it could be unreasonable in both time and money costs to try and collect thoughts from every single person in the population. This is where sampling comes in. The goal of sampling is to only take a subset of the population, using the responses from that subset to make an inference about the whole population. Here, we'll cover two basic probabilistic techniques that are commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest of these approaches is simple **random sampling**. In a simple random sample, each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. We just randomly make draws from the population until we have the sample size desired; your sample size depends on the level of uncertainty you are willing to have about the collected data. Since everyone has an equal chance of being drawn, we can expect the feature distribution of selected units to be similar to the distribution of the population as a whole. In addition, a simple random sample is easy to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible that certain groups are underrepresented in a simple random sample, especially those that make up a low proportion of the population. If there are certain rarer subgroups of interest, it can be worth adding one additional step and performing **stratified random sampling**. In a stratified random sample, we need to first divide the entire population into disjoint groups, or strata. That is, each individual must be a part of one group, and only one group. For example, you could divide people by gender (male, female, other), or age (e.g. 18-25, 26-35, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, from each group, you take a simple random sample. In a proportional sample, the sample size is proportional to how large the group is in the full population. For example, if you require 1000 data points, and stratified individuals of proportion {0.5, 0.3, 0.2}, then you would take 500 people from the first group, 300 from the second, and 200 from the third. This guarantees a certain level of knowledge from each subset, and theoretically a more representative overall inference on the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to take a nonproportional sample from each group. For example, we could simply sample 500 people from each group. Computing the overall statistics in this case requires weighting each group separately, but this extra effort offers a higher understanding of each subgroup in a deeper investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side Note: Non-Probabilistic Sampling\n",
    "As noted at the start, the goal of sampling is to use a subset of the whole population to make inferences about the full population, so that we didn't need to record data from everyone. To that end, probabilistic sampling techniques were described above to try and obtain a sample that was representative of the whole. However, it's useful to note that there also exist non-probabilistic sampling techniques that simplify the sampling process, at the risk of harming the validity of your results. (We'll discuss the term 'validity' later in the lesson.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a convenience sample records information from readily available units. Studies performed in the social sciences at colleges often fall into this kind of sampling. The people participating in these tasks are often just college students, rather than representatives of the population at large. When performing inferences from this type of study, it's important to consider how well your results might apply to the population at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable example of a convenience sample resulting in a grave error comes from the prediction made by magazine \"The Literary Digest\" on the 1936 U.S. presidential election. While they predicted a healthy victory by candidate Alf Landon, the final result ended with a landslide victory by opposing candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt. This major error is attributed to their methods capturing a non-representative sample of the population, which included looking at the results of a mail-in survey from their magazine readers. Since the mail-ins were voluntary, and the magazine subscribers were already not well-representative of the general population, focusing on the people who returned surveys gave a large bias toward Landon."

    "## Measuring Outcomes\n",
    "The goals of your study may not be the same as the way you evaluate the study's success. Perhaps this is because the goal is something that can't be measured directly. Let's say that you have an idea of a website addition that improves user satisfaction. How should we measure this? In order to evaluate whether or not this improvement has happened, you need to have a way to objectively measure the effect of the addition. For example, you might include a survey to random users to have them rate their website experience on a 1-10 scale. If the addition is helpful, then we should expect the average rating to be higher for those users who are given the addition, versus those who are not. The rating scale acts as a concrete way of measuring user satisfaction. These objective features by which you evaluate performance are known as **evaluation metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, it's a good idea to consider the goals of a study separate from the evaluation metrics. This provides a couple of useful benefits. First, this makes it clear that the metric isn't the main point of a study: it's the implications of the metric relative to the goal that matters. This is especially important if a metric isn't directly attached to the goal. For example, measuring students' confidence going into a standardized test might be a proxy for the goal of test preparedness, in the absence of being able to get their test scores directly or in a timely fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, having the metric separate from the goal can clarify the purpose of conducting the study or experiment. It makes sure we can answer the question of why we want to run a study or experiment. From the above example, we aren't measuring confidence just to make people feel good about themselves: we're doing it to try and improve their actual performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side Note: Alternate Terminology\n",
    "You might hear other terminology for goals and evaluation metrics than those used in this course. In the social sciences, it's common to hear a \"construct\" as analogous to the goal or objective under investigation, and the \"operational definition\" as the way outcomes are measured. For example, the construct of \"reaction time\" could be operationally defined as \"time in milliseconds to click on the correctly indicated button.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In general company operations, you might encounter the terms \"key results\" (KRs) or \"key performance indicators\" (KPIs) as ways of measuring progress against quarterly or annual \"objectives.\" These objectives and KRs / KPIs serve a similar purpose as study goals and evaluation metrics, and might even be driving factors in the creation of an experiment."
